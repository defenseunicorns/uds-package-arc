# Kibbles and Bits 
 
This Zarf package installs [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller) (ARC) and deploys a self hosted GitHub Actions runner.

A GitHub App is installed to authenticate to GitHub and register runners. This is preferable to using Personal Access Tokens, which are tied to a specific user's identity.

The runner is installed as a [scale set](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/docs/preview/gha-runner-scale-set-controller/README.md). This is a new (preview) GitHub feature for self hosted runner which is more secure and more efficient. Scale sets support scaling to zero when not in use. Also, the runner is significantly more secure, because the (org) runner registration token is not exposed to runners, instead only a per-workflow JIT token is used.

The runners are installed using the [`containerMode: kubernetes` mode of ARC](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/docs/deploying-alternative-runners.md#runner-with-k8s-jobs). This uses the k8s hooks from [runner-container-hooks](https://github.com/actions/runner-container-hooks) to run each job of the pipeline as a Kubernetes Pod with the workflow specified container image. Note that all workflow jobs MUST [specify a `container:`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#example-using-a-dockerfile-in-your-repository). Also, [docker container actions that use `runs.image: Dockerfile`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#example-using-a-dockerfile-in-your-repository) are NOT compatible (if they use a public Docker image instead of `Dockerfile` they are compatible though). Also, `docker` will not be usable within the workflow steps and `docker build` will not work.

There is an alternative `containerMode: dind` which removes these restrictions but it uses a privileged Docker sidecar container to execute containers and run `docker` commands. Due to it's use of privileged it provides significantly less security isolation.

Note that the k8s container hooks do not currently support configuring the Pod spec of workflow pods and resource limits or custom volume mounts are not currently possible, see https://github.com/actions/runner-container-hooks/pull/50#issuecomment-1551874570. If you require this immediately, a hacky solution is to use a mutating admission webhook such as Kyverno to mutate Pods named `*-workflow`.

## Installation

The following instructions describe how to create and install a GitHub App onto a GitHub _org_. A similar process can be used to install the GitHub App onto a single repository only. Note, that you can also install the GitHub App onto an org and limit it's "Repository access" to "Only select repositories".

See the upstream ARC documentation for full installation steps:  
https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/docs/authenticating-to-the-github-api.md#deploying-using-github-app-authentication

1. **Create an GitHub App on your GitHub org**
   * Contrary to the ARC documentation, "Administration (read / write)" permissions are not required.
   * You may use the following URL to create the application on an org. Replace `:org` in the following URL with the name of your org:
     ```
     https://github.com/organizations/:org/settings/apps/new?url=http://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller&webhook_active=false&public=false&organization_self_hosted_runners=write&actions=read&checks=read
     ```
2. **Record the "App ID" in the App's settings**
    * This is the `GITHUB_APP_ID` Zarf variable
3. **In the App's settings, generate and download a private key file by clicking "Generate a private key"**
    * This is `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` Zarf variable
    * Due to a Zarf variable issue, you will need to include literal `\n` to create newlines in the variable
4. **In the App's settings, click "Install App" on the left, and install the application on the org**
    * Record the installation ID (it is at the end of URL), this is the `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` Zarf variable
    * If desired, you may limit the installation's "Repository access" to "Only select repositories"
5. **The URL of the org the application was installed on is `GITHUB_CONFIG_URL`**
6. **Create a `zarf-config.toml` with the variables configured as desired:**
   ```toml
   [package.deploy.set]

   # The URL of the GitHub org that the GitHub App is installed on
   github_config_url = "https://github.com/octocat"
   
   # The id of the GitHub App
   github_app_id = "123"
   
   # The id of the installation of the GitHub App on the org
   # This id can be found in the URL of the installation's settings
   github_app_installation_id = "456"
   
   # The private key of the GitHub App
   github_app_private_key = """-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n
   ...\n
   ...\n
   ...\n
   -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"""
   
   # Optional. The name of the runner group to register the scale set in
   # You must first create the runner group in the GitHub UI manually before setting it here
   #github_runner_group="default"
   
   # The name of the runner scale set
   # This value is effectively a GitHub runs-on label for the runners. Note the runners will not have an "on-prem" label
   github_runner_scaleset_name = "arc"
   
   # The storage class name used for the Kubernetes ephemeral volume (temporary PVC/PV) used for the working directory of workflow execution.
   # If using k3s/k3d you can use the `local-path` storage class.
   github_runner_storage_class = "local-path"
   
   # Optional. The size of the ephemeral volume
   # Note, local-path does not enforce storage limits.
   #github_runner_storage_size = 1Gi
   
   # Optional. The maximum number of runners to run concurrently.
   #github_max_runners = 5
   
   # Optional. The minimum number of runners to scale down to.
   # By default it will scale to zero.
   #github_min_runners = 0
   ```
7. Install the actions-runner-controler Zarf package
   ```bash
   zarf package deploy oci://ghcr.io/defenseunicorns/packages/actions-runner-controller:0.0.1-amd64
   ```

Useful debug commands:
```bash
# TODO: verify with scale sets:


# actions controller logs, includes 401 error if PAT is bad
# should show no errors
kubectl logs -n arc-systems deployment/arc-actions-runner-controller -f

# Inspect the runners:
kubectl get RunnerDeployment,Runner,Pods -n arc-runners

# If the Secret is updated, the actions-runner-controller is not automatically restarted
# You need to restart it manually
# This is arguably a bug in the actions-runner-controller helm chart
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n arc-systems

# Runner should appear as "idle" at:
# https://github.com/defenseunicorns/kibbles-AND-bits/settings/actions/runners


#debug ephemeral runner Pods:

kubectl get pods -n arc-runners  -w -o 'custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,IMAGES:.spec.containers[*].image,VOLUMES:.spec.volumes[*].name,PHASE:.status.phase'

kubectl get pods -n arc-runners -o yaml -w
```

## IaC Deploy

IaC for deployments has 2 steps: 
1. [Deploy Terraform Bucket and DynamoDB](#terraform-state-bucket--dynamodb)  for lock files.
  1. *Optional* Test with a test bucket deployment. 
1. Deploy a single node [Zarf instance](#iac-zarf-instance)

This deployment will allow AWS to manage the statefile and lock for local deployments and with a team and for setting up for IaC through GitHub Actions or other CD automation.


### Terraform State Bucket & DynamoDB

First deployment needs to set up bucket for the Terrraform state files for team collaborations and a DynamoDB table for locking state. The goal is to boot strap a deployment cluster. The Terraform state bucket and DynamoDB lock table will then beable to be used to any IaC deployment through CI/CD systems on the Zarf Cluster. This simplified setup will be used to support all IaC operations local to the account or run from the account.

**Steps To Deploy:** 
* Ensure AWS CLI is working and has a connection to the account. 
* Change directory in to the folder in this repo `terraform/apps/tfinit`
* `terraform init`
* `terraform apply -auto-approve`
* Bask in your own success.

**If already deployed:**
If already deployed and the stateful is lost. 
* Ensure AWS CLI is working and has a connection to the account. 
* Change directory in to the folder in this repo `terraform/apps/tfinit`
* `terraform init`
* `bash importer.sh` # Will generate the state file from existing AWS state
* `terraform apply -auto-approve`
* Bask in your own success.

### IaC Zarf Instance

Deploys an EC2 instance. Automatically (via Cloud-Init shell script) will:
* Install Zarf CLI and Zarf init packages from GitHub
* Install k3s via `sudo zarf init --components k3s --confirm`

**Steps to Deploy:**
* Ensure [Deploy Terraform Bucket and DynamoDB](#terraform-state-bucket--dynamodb) has been run already. 
* Change directory in to the folder in this repo `terraform/apps/zarf-runner`.
* `terraform init`
* `terraform apply -auto-approve`
* SSH into the instance, to confirm the cloud init script is done running:
  * First run `sudo cloud-init status`
  * Watch with `sudo tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.txt` and wait for a completed message.
* **TODO:** Handle with secrets or extend automation to include efforts in [Zarf package workflow](#zarf-package-workflow).

**Steps to Destroy:**
* In the same folder, run `terraform destroy -auto-approve`. State file is managed by the S3 and DynamoDB.

### IaC Testing/Bonus

There are two projects used to verify that the TF init works and can be used an example of using the provisioned Terraforom S3 bucket for state files and using DynamoDB. First is a simple example in `examples/makebucket`. Another is a basic EC2 instance deployed via Terraform and the AWS managed state in `modules/ec2/`. 

**Steps for makebucket:**
* Ensure AWS CLI is working and has a connection to the account. 
* Change directory in to the folder in this repo `examples/makebucket`
* `terraform init`
* `terraform apply -auto-approve`
* To destroy (if empty), `terraform destroy -auto-approve`

**EC2 Module:**
* View the Read Me file in `terraform/modules/ec2/README.md`
* Copy the sample Terraform code from the code block in the Read Me file anywhere locally EXCEPT in the same folder.
* Set the line for `source = "./ec2"` path explicitely or relatively from saved Terraform file to the `ec2` folder.
* Fill in module variables as needed/desired.
* Ensure AWS CLI is working and has a connection to the account. 
* Change directory in to the folder in this repo `examples/makebucket`
* `terraform init`
* `terraform apply -auto-approve`
* To destroy (if empty), `terraform destroy -auto-approve`
